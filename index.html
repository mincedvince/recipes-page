        >apple pie</a><p></p><img src="images/applePie2.jpg"><h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. 
        It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>8 small Granny Smith apples, or as needed</li>
            <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>¼ cup water</li>
            <li>1 (9 inch) double-crust pie pastry, thawed</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel and core apples, then thinly slice. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and stir to form a paste;
                cook until fragrant, about 1 to 2 minutes. Add both sugars and water; bring to a boil.
                Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>
            <li>Press one pastry into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie pan. Roll out 
                remaining pastry so it will overhang the pie by about 1/2 inch. Cut pastry into 
                eight 1-inch strips.</li>
            <li>Place sliced apples into the bottom crust, forming a slight mound. Lay four pastry 
                strips vertically and evenly spaced over apples, using longer strips in the center 
                and shorter strips at the edges.</li>
            <li>Make a lattice crust: Fold the first and third strips all the way back so they're 
                almost falling off the pie. Lay one of the unused strips perpendicularly over the 
                second and fourth strips, then unfold the first and third strips back into their 
                original position.</li>
            <li>Fold the second and fourth vertical strips back. Lay one of the three unused strips 
                perpendicularly over top. Unfold the second and fourth strips back into their original 
                position.</li>
            <li>Repeat Steps 6 and 7 to weave in the last two strips of pastry. Fold and trim excess 
                dough at the edges as necessary, and pinch to secure.</li>
            <li>Slowly and gently pour sugar-butter mixture over lattice crust, making sure it seeps 
                over sliced apples. Brush some onto lattice, but make sure it doesn't run off the 
                sides.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F 
                (175 degrees C) and continue baking until apples are soft, 35 to 45 minutes.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Libby's pumpkin pie is a true classic. This recipe for traditional 
        pumpkin pie in a deep-dish crust is so easy to make</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>

            <li>1 (9 inch) unbaked deep-dish pie crust</li>
            <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground cloves</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can LIBBY'S® 100% Pure Pumpkin</li>
            <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can NESTLE® CARNATION® Evaporated Milk</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Combine sugar, cinnamon, salt, ginger, and cloves in small bowl. Beat eggs lightly 
                in large bowl. Stir in pumpkin and sugar-spice mixture. Gradually stir in evaporated 
                milk. Pour into pie shell. </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce temperature to 350 degrees F 
                (175 degrees C) and continue to bake until a knife inserted near the center comes 
                out clean, 40 to 50 more minutes. Remove from the oven and set on a wire rack to 
                cool to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Serve cooled pie immediately or refrigerate until ready to serve. 
                (Do not freeze as this will cause the crust to separate from the filling.)</li>
