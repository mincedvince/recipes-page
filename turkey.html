    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (18 pound) whole turkey</li>
        <li>8 cups prepared stuffing</li>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 ½ quarts turkey stock, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place a rack in the
            lowest position of the oven.</li>
        <li>Remove turkey neck and giblets. Rinse turkey and pat dry with paper towels.</li>
        <li>Place turkey, breast-side up, on a rack in a roasting pan. Loosely fill 
            turkey cavity with stuffing. Rub skin with butter, then season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Pour 2 cups of turkey stock into the roasting pan. 
            Loosely tent turkey with aluminum foil. </li>
        <li>Roast turkey for 2 1/2 hours, basting with pan juices every 30 minutes. When 
            drippings evaporate, add remaining stock to the pan, 1 to 2 cups at a time.</li>
        <li>Remove foil and continue roasting until a meat thermometer inserted in 
            thickest part of thigh reads 165 degrees F (75 degrees C), about 1 1/2 hours more.</li>
        <li>Transfer turkey to a large serving platter. Let stand for 20 to 30 minutes before carving.</li>
