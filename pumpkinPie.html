    <p>Libby's pumpkin pie is a true classic. This recipe for traditional 
    pumpkin pie in a deep-dish crust is so easy to make</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (9 inch) unbaked deep-dish pie crust</li>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cloves</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can LIBBY'S® 100% Pure Pumpkin</li>
        <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can NESTLE® CARNATION® Evaporated Milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Combine sugar, cinnamon, salt, ginger, and cloves in small bowl. Beat eggs lightly 
            in large bowl. Stir in pumpkin and sugar-spice mixture. Gradually stir in evaporated 
            milk. Pour into pie shell. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce temperature to 350 degrees F 
            (175 degrees C) and continue to bake until a knife inserted near the center comes 
            out clean, 40 to 50 more minutes. Remove from the oven and set on a wire rack to 
            cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Serve cooled pie immediately or refrigerate until ready to serve. 
            (Do not freeze as this will cause the crust to separate from the filling.)</li>
    </ol>
